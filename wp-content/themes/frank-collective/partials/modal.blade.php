                <p>Jiffy began her production career at BBDO NY. As one of the first producers for the newly created content division, she was responsible for developing and producing projects that fell out of traditional categories. One of her most notable jobs was as the content producer for the award-winning HBO Voyeur campaign that has become an example of multi-platform, integrated storytelling. Leaving BBDO in 2008, she joined Radical Mediaâ€™s Design + Digital department to produce and manage all motion projects where she developed more of a practical production skill set and gained a broader understanding of how to create animation, video/film production and post.</p>
                <p>Past clients include  Grey Goose, Tommy Hilfiger, Viacom, NASA, AMC, OWN, TED, Target, eBay, and projects have ranged from short form documentary, animation, broadcast commercials, apps, websites, identity design and branding. She founded Frank Collective in 2011 to work with established and emerging brands to create innovative serial content and branding. Currently, she lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two dogs and works between the Frank headquarters office in DUMBO, Brooklyn and the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles. She is also an Executive Member of Women in Film as well as an Emmy Nominated Producer.</p>
